<h3>Canada Facts </h3>
<hr height="50%">
<br>There are 4 seasons here and its cold in winter.
<blockquote>
"No winter lasts forever;no spring skips its turn." "The color of springtime is flowers;the color of winter is in our imagination.""Blow,blow,thou winter wind, thou art not so
unkind as man's ingratitude.""There is no winter without snow, no spring without sunshine, and no happiness without companions."
</blockquote>
<br>We shall buy our winter clothing here so that it is warm enough to withstand climatic temperature</p>
